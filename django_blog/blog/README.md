# Tagging and Search Features

## Tagging
- Posts can be tagged with keywords or categories.
- Tags are displayed on each post's detail page.
- Clicking on a tag shows all posts with that tag.

## Search
- A search bar allows users to find posts by title, content, or tags.
- Search results display all matching posts.

## How to Use
1. Add tags when creating or editing posts.
2. Use the search bar at the top of the page to find posts by keyword.
3. Click on a tag to view related posts.

## Notes
- Tags are case-insensitive and automatically slugified.
- The search feature ignores punctuation and matches partial words.
